-Inferior input when attaching

Test:
    -Shell spawn / multiple threads
    -Docker setup + attach
    -step through more challanges
    -payload insert test (run < payload)
    -Shell spawn in local execution (inferior working?)
    -clean install (gdb -> pwndbg -> pwndbg-gui)
    -final test on Laptop

Future Features:
    -Window for got command
    -Window for elf command (one execution is enough)
    -Window for checksec command (one execution is enough)
    -Search command in main window
    -
    
Known Limitations (and facts):
    -User can not start/attach process via the main command window -> only GUI buttons
    -.gdbinit can not include any "python....end" blocks. This will break the gui when trying to load it.
    -Stack lines update on startup
    -pwndbg next instructions (e.g. nextret, nextcall, ...) will output the entire pwndbg context WITHOUT RESULT DONE! which will send it to our regs context  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    -when attaching the source code dir must be specified BEFORE attaching via gui

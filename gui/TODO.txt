Fix:
If you are experiencing issues on startup relating to QT plugins not being found or loaded try to set QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1
and retry. This will show you more debug output related to QT. Most likely you will have some missing dependencies that
can be installed via you favourite package manager. On Ubuntu/Debian it was the `libxcb-cursor0` library.

Test:
    -Shell spawn / multiple threads
    -Docker setup + attach
    -step through more challanges
    -payload insert test (run < payload)
    -Shell spawn in local execution (inferior working?)
    -clean install (gdb -> pwndbg -> pwndbg-gui)
    -final test on Laptop

Future Features:
    -Window for got command
    -Window for elf command (one execution is enough)
    -Window for checksec command (one execution is enough)
    -Search command in main window
    - Easier inputting of payloads (e.g. via files)
    - Setting breakpoint in source or disassembly via GUI
    - Customize contexts arrangement
      - Pop out contexts into separate windows
      - Rearrange and move contexts around in the GUI
    - Editing of memory (e.g. registers, stack, heap) via UI (e.g. double-click on stack line)
    
Known Limitations (and facts):
    -User can not start/attach process via the main command window -> only GUI buttons
    -Stack lines update on startup
    -pwndbg next instructions (e.g. nextret, nextcall, ...) will output the entire pwndbg context WITHOUT RESULT DONE! which will send it to our regs context  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    -when attaching the source code dir must be specified manually when not in docker

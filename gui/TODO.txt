QT sudo fix on Ubuntu

-Inferior input when attaching
-Hexdump error output still does not arrive in context

Test:
    -Shell spawn / multiple threads
    -Docker setup + attach
    -step through more challanges
    -payload insert test (run < payload)
    -clean install (gdb -> pwndbg -> pwndbg-gui)
    -final test on Laptop

Future Features:
    -Window for got command
    -Window for elf command (one execution is enough)
    -Window for checksec command (one execution is enough)
    -Search command in main window

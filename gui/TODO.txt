-Inferior input when attaching
-Error message to user when unsuccessful attach
-Continuing into an segfault only gives "stopped" message and no result -> segfault error is not send to main
-Attaching after a already died process results in non updating context for initial attach -> probably inferior state wrong

Test:
    -Shell spawn / multiple threads
    -Docker setup + attach
    -step through more challanges
    -payload insert test (run < payload)
    -clean install (gdb -> pwndbg -> pwndbg-gui)
    -final test on Laptop

Future Features:
    -Window for got command
    -Window for elf command (one execution is enough)
    -Window for checksec command (one execution is enough)
    -Search command in main window
    -Stack lines update on startup
    
Known Limitations:
    -User can not start/attach process via the main command window -> only GUI buttons
    -.gdbinit can not include any "python....end" blocks. This will break the gui when trying to load it.
